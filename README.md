# Fall2016FinalProject

This is the final project for CIS 120 at Penn. I created a Boggle game in Java using object-oriented programming concepts. 

Topics covered in class and incorporated in the project include: 

- Data types and data representation
- Abstraction, interfaces, and modularity
- Test-driven development
- Programming patterns (recursion, iteration, events, call-backs, collections, map-reduce, GUIs, â€¦)
- Functional programming
- How and when to use mutable state
- Object-oriented programming
